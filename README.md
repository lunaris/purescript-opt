# purescript-optimisation

A library and associated executables for optimising PureScript programs and the
JavaScript generated by such programs when compiled with `psc`.

## Currently-supported optimisations

* Inlining of identity functions (applications of declarations whose
  definitions resemble `function f(x) { return x; }`). Common examples of such
  functions include `newtype` constructors and `foreign import`s required for
  the purpose of type coercion.

* Inlining of property-accessor functions (applications of declarations whose
  definitions resemble `function f(x) { return x.p; }`). A common use case for
  this is when eliminating code around type-class dictionaries and their
  members.

* Inlining of operator aliases (e.g. `<$>` for `map`).

## Outstanding optimisations/options for further improvement

* Inlining of functions which serve only to create objects (e.g. applications
  of declarations whose definitions resemble
  `function f(p1, ...) { return { p1: p1, ... }`).

* Inlining of identity-like functions (e.g. `const`).

* Specialisation and subsequent inlining of certain type-class dictionaries
  e.g. `Functor Const` and `Functor Identity`.

* Uncurrying of fully-saturated function applications.
